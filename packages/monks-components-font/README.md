## Installation
Fontsource assumes you are using a bundler, such as Webpack, to load in CSS. Solutions like CRA, Gatsby and Next.js are prebuilt examples that are compatible.

```bash
yarn add @arthurjdam/monks-components-font // npm install @arthurjdam/monks-components-font
```

## Usage
Use a bundler such as webpack, rollup or grunt to load in CSS. Solutions like [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) are prebuilt examples that are compatible.
